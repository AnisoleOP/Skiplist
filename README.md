# Skiplist

This is a Java implementation of the Data Structure - Skiplist

# Node:
- int key : stores the numeric value of the node.
- Node above, below, next, prev : stores the nodes respective to that node. 

# Features:
- This code first creates a file of 1000 random numbers. The file is then read and one by one all numbers are inserted in the skiplist.
- It supports searching of a key, deletion of a node and traverse the list.

# Current issues:
- The output is not displayed in a pretty manner since there are a lot of numbers involved.
- Since 1000 random numbers are being generated, not always there will be all numbers distinct hence there are < 1000 numbers in height = 0.
